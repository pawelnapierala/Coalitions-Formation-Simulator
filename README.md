# Coalitions-Formation-Simulator
This is a simulator for coalitions formation in multi-agent systems that I wrote as my Bachelor's thesis. The autonomous agents use a protocol I designed. You can find more information in my [thesis](http://pawelnapierala.me/uploads/Bachelorarbeit.pdf) (German).

You can download the ready executable .jar file [here](http://pawelnapierala.me/uploads/coalitions_formation_simulator.zip).
